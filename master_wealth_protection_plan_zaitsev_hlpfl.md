## The HLPFL Advantage: Why This Matters

Noah, you're not just a client—you're a partner. Your 10% stake in Zaitsev Holding Group means your success directly amplifies mine, and vice versa. This document isn't a sales pitch; it's a blueprint for building generational wealth together.

### What Makes This Different

| Traditional Service | HLPFL Partnership Approach |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Files paperwork, moves on | Ongoing strategic partnership |
| Generic templates | Custom structure integrated with Zaitsev ecosystem |
| Hourly billing adds up | Partner pricing with equity alignment |
| You're a number | You're family (Article 1.7 of Zaitsev Operating Agreement) |
| No skin in the game | Your success = my success (10% allocation) |

Your ~$10K payout is the beginning. The structure we're building today will handle $100K months, $1M years, and eventual exits.

## How HLPFL Helps You Specifically

### 1. LLC Formation &amp; Operating Agreements

**What I'm handling for you:**

- Wyoming Holding LLC formation via Wyoming Registered Agent ($104)
- Wyoming Consulting LLC formation via Wyoming Registered Agent ($104)
- Ohio foreign qualification filing ($99)
- Custom operating agreements (not templates—drafted specifically for your situation)
- EIN registration for both entities
- NOVO business bank account setup
- Integration with Zaitsev Holding Group structure if desired

**Why Through HLPFL:**

- I've already built the Zaitsev structure—your entities can integrate seamlessly
- I know your full financial picture (PRIV artist income, W-2, consulting, Zaitsev distributions)
- No handoff to strangers who don't understand the bigger vision

### 2. The Cross-Pollination Opportunity

Your Consulting LLC can provide legitimate services back to HLPFL ecosystem entities:

- Financial analysis consulting for HLPFL artists (market research, revenue projections)
- Trading education content for HLPFL's future creator economy platform
- Technical analysis for potential HLPFL investment decisions
- Advisory services to other Zaitsev portfolio companies

This creates circular value: Your consulting generates income, HLPFL gets quality services at fair rates, and the entire ecosystem grows.

## The Wyoming LLC Structure Explained

As an Ohio resident with W-2 income and business profits, the optimal structure separates assets from operations while maximizing tax efficiency.

### Recommended Entity Structure

**Wyoming Holding LLC (Asset Protection Layer):**

- Business profits deposited here
- Asset protection layer
- Owns investment accounts
- 100% owns the Consulting LLC subsidiary

**Wyoming Consulting LLC (Operating Entity):**

- Consulting activities occur here
- Financial consulting services
- S-Corp election for tax savings
- Legitimate business expenses

### Key Insight

Your personal business LLC and your Zaitsev stake are separate but synergistic. Business profits can fund investments into Zaitsev opportunities. Zaitsev distributions diversify your income beyond business volatility.

## NAICS Codes for Your Entities

| Entity | Primary NAICS | Backup NAICS |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Holding LLC | 523900 (Other Financial Investment Activities) | 523940 (Portfolio Management) |
| Consulting LLC | 541611 (Administrative Management Consulting) | 541990 (Other Professional Services) |

## Ohio Tax Reality: What You Actually Owe

Critical finding: Ohio will tax your Wyoming LLC income regardless of where it's formed. But there's good news.

### Ohio Tax Treatment Summary

| Income Type | State Income Tax | Commercial Activity Tax | Municipal Tax |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| Business Profits | TAXABLE | TAXABLE (if >$6M) | TAXABLE |
| Investment Income | TAXABLE | EXEMPT | EXEMPT |
| PRIV Artist Royalties | TAXABLE | TAXABLE (if >$6M) | TAXABLE |
| Zaitsev Distributions | TAXABLE | EXEMPT | EXEMPT |

The exemption of investment income from CAT and municipal taxes is significant. Your investment profits only face state income tax (top rate 3.99%) plus federal taxes—no municipal income tax bite.

---

## Ohio Foreign Qualification

Since you're operating from Ohio, we must register your Wyoming LLCs as foreign entities:

- Form 617 (Registration of Foreign LLC): $99
- Processing time: ~7 days
- Required Ohio statutory agent (I can coordinate this)

**Penalty for skipping this**: Can't enforce contracts in Ohio courts, potential fines, back filing fees with interest.

---

## Vehicle Strategy (Under 6,000 GVWR)

Since your vehicle is under 6,000 lbs, you face luxury auto depreciation caps.

### 2026 Depreciation Limits

| Year | With Bonus Depreciation | Without Bonus |
|------|-------------------------|---------------|
| Year 1 | $20,200 | $12,200 |
| Year 2 | $19,600 | $19,600 |
| Year 3 | $11,800 | $11,800 |
| Year 4+ | $7,060 | $7,060 |

### Recommendation: Standard Mileage + Personal Ownership

- 2026 standard mileage rate: 72.5 cents/mile

**Why this approach:**

- Simpler documentation (just mileage log vs. all receipts)
- Flexibility to switch methods later
- No recapture risk if business use changes
- Consulting LLC reimburses you at the standard rate = tax-free to you, deductible to LLC

**Critical limitation**:

Working from home means very limited legitimate business mileage. Only deductible trips:
- Meeting with clients, or partners
- Business seminars and education events
- Meetings with accountants or attorneys
- Bank/notary visits for business

**Not deductible**: Commuting to any fixed location, even a coworking space you use regularly.

## Retirement Account Strategy (With W-2 Income)

Your W-2 income creates both opportunities and limitations for retirement savings.

### 2026 Contribution Limits

| Account | 2026 Limit | Your Eligibility |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| 401(k) Employee Deferral | $24,500 | If your employer offers one |
| Solo 401(k) Total | $72,000 | From self-employment income only |
| IRA | $7,500 | Yes |
| HSA (Family) | $8,750 | If on HDHP |

### The Critical Aggregation Rule

Employee deferral limits are per person, not per plan. If you max out your employer's 401(k) at $24,500, you can contribute $0 in employee deferrals to a Solo 401(k). However, you CAN still make employer profit-sharing contributions (up to 20% of net SE income).

### Backdoor Roth Strategy

With combined W-2 + business income likely exceeding Roth IRA limits ($246,000 MFJ for 2026), use the backdoor:

- Contribute $7,500 to Traditional IRA (non-deductible)
- Convert immediately to Roth IRA
- No income limits on conversions

**Warning**: If you have ANY pre-tax money in Traditional, SEP, or SIMPLE IRAs, you'll owe tax on a proportional share. Solution: Roll pre-tax IRA money into your employer's 401(k) first.
