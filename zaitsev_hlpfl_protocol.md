# The Zaitsev-Hlpfl Protocol

**Your Master Wealth Protection Plan**

---

This plan assigns specific strategic roles to Zaitsev LLC and Hlpfl Co LLC to maximize asset protection, tax efficiency, and operational clarity for your Ohio-based day trading and consulting journey.

---

## The Structural Logic

To achieve the "Master Wealth Protection" standard, we must separate **Assets** (what you own) from **Operations** (what you do).

---

## Zaitsev LLC (The Vault)

**Role:** Wyoming Holding Company

**Function:** Owns your intellectual property, long-term investment accounts, and 100% of Hlpfl Co LLC.

**Why "Zaitsev"?** Like the famous sniper, this entity is hidden, patient, and precise. It sits in Wyoming, protected by strong charging order laws. It does not deal with the public.

**The Investment:** The ~$10k payout and all future surplus capital are deposited here.

---

## Hlpfl Co LLC (The Engine)

**Role:** Operating & Consulting Subsidiary

**Function:** Face of the franchise. Signs consulting contracts, interacts with clients, and generates active income.

**Why "Hlpfl"?** It represents the service side ("Helpful"). It takes the liability risk. If a consulting client sues, they hit this entity, not the vault.

---

## The Trading Vehicle (The Pivot)

**Critical Decision:** While the generic plan suggests placing trading in the Operating LLC, I recommend placing the Trading Account under Zaitsev LLC (The Vault) or a dedicated separate subsidiary, not Hlpfl Co LLC.

**Why?** You do not want your trading capital exposed to a lawsuit from a consulting client in Hlpfl Co. Zaitsev LLC is cleaner.

**Ohio Tax Note:** Since day trading gains are exempt from Ohio CAT and Municipal Tax, trading inside Zaitsev (registered as foreign in Ohio only if required by active trading volume) or Hlpfl is tax-neutral, but Zaitsev is protection-positive.

## Immediate Action Checklist: The Zaitsev Protocol

### Day 1: Capital Deployment (Payout Day)

**Deposit:** Deposit the ~$10k payout into your personal account, then immediately transfer it to the Zaitsev LLC bank account as a "Capital Contribution."

**Documentation:** Record this transfer. Zaitsev LLC now has the seed capital.

**Allocation:**
- **$500 - $1,000:** Keep in Zaitsev LLC for administrative costs (registered agent fees, filings).
- **$9,000:** Deploy to the trading brokerage account opened in the name of Zaitsev LLC.

### Day 2-7: Structural Integration

**Hlpfl Co LLC Cleanup:**
- Ensure Hlpfl Co LLC's Operating Agreement lists Zaitsev LLC as the 100% owner (Member).
- This creates the parent-child asset protection link.

**Ohio Foreign Qualification:**
- **Hlpfl Co LLC:** Must be registered in Ohio (Form 617) because it has consulting clients there.
- **Zaitsev LLC:** If it only holds assets and trades for its own account, it may not need Ohio registration (check "safe harbor" rules for holding companies), but if you are actively day trading (TTS), registration is safer to avoid penalties.

### Day 30: The Tax & Wealth Setup

**Mark-to-Market (MTM) Review:** Since Zaitsev LLC is the trader, the Section 475 election (if chosen by April 15, 2026) would apply to Zaitsev's trading activities.

**Bank Accounts:**
- **Zaitsev Account:** Receives dividends from Hlpfl Co + Trading Withdrawals.
- **Hlpfl Account:** Receives consulting fees. Pays consulting expenses. Transfers net profit to Zaitsev.

## Strategic Analysis for the Client

### 1. The "Invest Into It" Narrative

Your client isn't just "spending money on LLCs"; they are capitalizing a family fund.

**Pitch:** "We are taking this $10k windfall and seeding Zaitsev LLC. This isn't just a trading account; it's a private equity holdco. Hlpfl Co LLC is just one portfolio company inside it. The trading profits stay in Zaitsev, protected from the consulting liability of Hlpfl, compounding tax-efficiently."

### 2. Ohio Compliance specific to Zaitsev/Hlpfl

**Hlpfl Co LLC (Consulting):**
- **CAT:** Liable if gross receipts > $6M (unlikely for now).
- **Muni Tax:** Liable on net consulting profit.

**Zaitsev LLC (Trading):**
- **CAT:** Exempt. (Trading gains are not "gross receipts" for CAT).
- **Muni Tax:** Exempt. (Intangible income like cap gains is exempt from municipal taxation for non-dealers).

**Result:** Zaitsev is an Ohio tax haven effectively, paying only the pass-through State Income Tax (max ~3.99%).

### 3. Future-Proofing (The "Sniper" Strategy)

**Growth:** When Hlpfl Co generates cash, dividend it up to Zaitsev.

**Diversification:** Zaitsev then buys real estate, crypto, or stocks.

**Privacy:** The public sees "Hlpfl Co LLC" on contracts. They never see "Zaitsev LLC" or the assets it holds.
