## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why Wyoming LLCs if I live in Ohio?**  
A: Wyoming has stronger asset protection laws, but you still register as foreign entity in Ohio for compliance.

**Q: Can I change the structure later?**  
A: Yes, but it's more expensive. Building correctly now saves time and money long-term.

**Q: What about the Section 475 MTM election?**  
A: Wait until you meet PDT requirements ($25K) and have consistent trading volume.

**Q: How do vehicle deductions work with home office?**  
A: Very limited. Only trips to meetings, seminars, or professional services qualify—not commuting.

**Q: Can I contribute to retirement accounts with trading income?**  
A: Yes, but need self-employment income. W-2 limits apply to employee deferrals.
